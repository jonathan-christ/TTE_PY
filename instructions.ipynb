    "<p>\n",
    "New and novel methods in Machine Learning are made either by borrowing formulas and concepts from other scientific fields and redefining it based on new sets of assumptions, or by adding an extra step to an already existing framework of methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise (Assignment 1 of the Clustering Topic), we will try to develop a novel method of Target Trial Emulation by integrating concepts of Clustering into the already existing framework. Target Trial Emulation is a new methodological framework in epidemiology which tries to account for the biases in old and traditional designs.\n",
